# Decomposition Strategies
  #### Breaking down a monolithic application into microservices is a strategic process that requires careful consideration of various decomposition strategies. Here are the key strategies, each of which provides a unique approach to carving out services from a monolithic codebase

   - **Decompose by Business Capability** :
    This strategy involves segmenting the application based on distinct business functionalities or capabilities. It's about identifying core business functions and creating services that correspond to each.

>       Advantages: Aligns closely with business goals and enables focused, independent development teams.
>       Challenges: Requires a deep understanding of the business domain and collaboration with domain experts.

- **Decompose by Subdomain (Domain-Driven Design)** :
   A subdomain is a segment of the domain model that has coherence within itself. DDD suggests creating services around these subdomains.

>       Advantages: Ensures that services have clear boundaries and reduces the risk of tight coupling.
>       Challenges: It can be complex to identify bounded contexts correctly and requires a steep learning curve in domain modeling.
-  **Decompose by Team Structure (Conway's Law)** :
  Conway's Law suggests that organizations will design systems that mirror their own communication structure. This strategy suggests aligning services with the structure of teams.
>     Advantages: Takes advantage of existing team dynamics and expertise.
>     Challenges: May not align perfectly with business capabilities or lead to the most efficient system architecture.
-  **Decompose by Transaction Boundary** :
    Services are created around transactional boundaries where a single business transaction is handled by a single service.
>     Advantages: Simplifies data consistency and integrity within each service.
>     Challenges: Some transactions may span multiple business capabilities, leading to more complex inter-service communication.
-  **Strangler Fig Pattern** :
  Gradually create new services and retire the old monolith functionality. The name comes from the Strangler Fig tree that gradually encompasses and outlives the host tree.
>        Advantages: Allows for a gradual transition with minimal disruption.
>        Challenges: Requires careful planning and management of two parallel systems during the transition phase.
-  **Event-Driven Decomposition** :
   Identify key business events and create services that subscribe to and publish these events.
>       Advantages: Natural fit for systems with asynchronous processing and workflows.
>       Challenges: Designing a comprehensive event model can be complex, and the system may become difficult to understand and debug.
-  **Service Template Pattern** :
 Standardize the creation of services by defining a template that includes common elements such as logging, monitoring, and communication protocols.
>       Advantages: Streamlines the creation and maintenance of services.
>       Challenges: Over-standardization can lead to rigidity and stifle innovation.
